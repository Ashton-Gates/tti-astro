</p> <p class="mb-4">
Created by intelligence researcher Ashton Kinnell, Project Ojo exposes how trafficking scouts operate—so travelers, locals, and field responders can recognize the signs early and protect themselves and others.
</p> <p class="mb-6 italic">
We don’t just say “stay safe.” We teach you how to read the signs before you’re targeted.
</p> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Our Mission</h2> <p class="mb-4">
To equip people with tactical, region-specific knowledge that identifies how human trafficking scouts operate—by pattern, location, and behavior. This platform empowers everyday people with real intelligence—not vague warnings.
</p> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What Makes Project Ojo Different</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> <li><strong>Open-source</strong> – Anyone can contribute, but every submission is vetted</li> <li><strong>Pattern-driven</strong> – Based on real-world behavior, not fear mongering</li> <li><strong>Regionally specific</strong> – Tactics vary by country—we track those changes</li> <li><strong>Traveler-first</strong> – Built for nomads, solo travelers, expats, and locals</li> <li><strong>Prevention-focused</strong> – Our goal is to intercept exploitation before it happens</li> </ul> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">The Backstory</h2> <p class="mb-4">
Project Ojo was born from frustration.
        Every travel guide and embassy post says:
</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> <li>“Avoid dangerous areas.”</li> <li>“Don’t talk to strangers.”</li> <li>“Stay alert.”</li> </ul> <p class="mb-4">
But nobody tells you:
</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> <li>What grooming actually looks like in a nightclub</li> <li>That bus terminals in some cities are known recruitment zones</li> <li>Or how traffickers use fake jobs, street greetings, and bars to lure people in</li> </ul> <p class="mb-4">
Trafficking prevention has been locked behind NGO silos and government databases for too long.
        We created Project Ojo to change that—by giving people access to the same pattern recognition used in field investigations.
</p> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Who Created Project Ojo?</h2> <p class="mb-4">
Ashton Kinnell is a U.S.-based intelligence researcher, prior U.S. Army Cyber Operations Specialist, and founder of the nonprofit NAM3LESS—an organization dedicated to building open-source intelligence tools that dismantle trafficking networks and support vulnerable populations.
</p> <p class="mb-4">
Ashton previously served as a software engineer at Google, contributing to Linux kernel development for the Privacy Sandbox team, with a focus on user protections and system security.
</p> <p class="mb-4">
They are also the founder of Arda, Inc. (Previously Atottemo, LLC), a fugitive intelligence startup supporting federal partners including BORTAC-SOD, Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), FBI C3, and the DEA-SOD.
</p> <p class="mb-4">
Currently supporting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), Ashton specializes in real-time trafficking patterns, victim identification, and threat analysis. Their expertise lies in tactical pattern analysis, trafficking disruption, and the ethical use of intelligence and AI in real-world investigations.
</p> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Project Ojo Is One of Three</h2> <p class="mb-4">
Project Ojo is part of a larger 3-phase initiative by NAM3LESS:
</p> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> <li><strong>Project Ojo</strong> – Tactical travel safety and pattern intel</li> <li><strong>Project Nameless</strong> – Victim identification through strategic, ethical surveillance and AI</li> <li><strong>Project Expose</strong> – Intelligence initiative focused on exposing trafficking leadership and criminal networks</li> </ul> <p class="mb-4">
Together, these projects work to expose trafficking methods, identify at-risk individuals, and protect survivors using open, accessible systems, effectively dissolving and disrupting trafficking operations.
</p> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What This Isn’t</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> <li>A rumor mill or fear campaign</li> <li>A static site—Ojo is continuously expanding as new data is submitted</li> </ul> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Who It’s For</h2> <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> <li>Solo travelers, backpackers, expats</li> <li>Locals in trafficking-prone areas</li> <li>Journalists and humanitarian workers</li> <li>Investigators and researchers</li> <li>Survivors who want to protect others</li> </ul> <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">The Name</h2> <p class="mb-4">
“Ojo” means eye in Spanish.
        This platform exists to keep an eye on the streets, an eye on the patterns, and an eye out for those who can’t always protect themselves.
